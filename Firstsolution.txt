Some possible solutions

- Use a bidding system: The guests could use a bidding system, with each person putting their cup on the table and bidding a certain number of points to have it filled. The person with the highest bid gets their cup filled.

- Use a rock-paper-scissors tournament: The guests could play a series of rock-paper-scissors games to determine the order in which they should put their cups on the table.

- Use a spinning top: The guests could spin a top, and the person whose cup is closest to the top when it stops spinning gets their cup filled.

- Use a coin flip: The guests could flip a coin, and the person whose cup is closest to the coin when it lands gets their cup filled.

- Use a timer: The guests could agree to use a timer, with the first person to put their cup on the table when the timer goes off being the one who gets their cup filled.

- Use a system of points: The guests could use a system of points, with each person earning a point for every cup they put on the table. The person with the most points at the end gets their cup filled.
