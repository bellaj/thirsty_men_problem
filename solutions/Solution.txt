Solution of Thirsty men problem

I propose 3 different approaches to this problem. All three use different yet effective approaches to solve the problem. The three approaches are:
	i) By Strategy
	ii) By Chance
	iii) By Cooperation
	

i) By Strategy:
	Well, this is the most exciting solution to the problem. Here, the planning and strategy-making capability of the guests will be tested. This solution is explained below:
Procedure:
1) Cups, named after guests, are randomly arranged on the table by the host.
2) Guests are moved to another room and called in one by one.
3) In the room, each guest shuffles the cups.
4) After the completion of the process, the host fills the first and last cups on the table with water.

Rules:
1) Each guest is randomly called by the host exactly twice, using a lottery system to avoid personal preferences.
2) Upon being called, a guest has two options: move two cups of choice except own or do nothing, earning a chance in the next call to move their cup by one position.
3) Guests have 30 seconds for calculations and cup movements to enhance their winning probability.
4) Guests can bluff or mislead others through verbal cues or coded messages.
5) Failure to act within the time limit results in a loss of opportunity.

Analysis:
-The strategy-based approach engages guests in a dynamic and competitive process.
-Elements of chance, psychology, and quick thinking contribute to the excitement.
-The game tests guests' planning capabilities and ensures a fair and strategic water distribution.
-The combination of rules provides an entertaining challenge for the participants.


ii) By Chance:
	This is a very simple yet very effective way to solve this problem. Here, N similar-looking cube cards will be taken and each will be numbered from 1 to N indicating the position of the cup on the table. Every guest will be requested to select a cube card of his/her choice. Once all the cards are chosen everyone will be requested to show the number written on the back of the cube card. The guests with numbers 1 and N will be provided with a cup of water. In this way, the chaos can be avoided and water can be distributed to the guest.
Analysis:
-This approach relies on chance and randomness.
-It avoids chaos and ensures a fair distribution of water.
-The potential issue is that there's no guarantee that the guests with the first and last cups are the most deserving or strategic.


iii) By Cooperation:
	This approach is for cooperative guests who can gel with each other to solve without having a clash of interests. As the name suggests, here the cooperation among the guests plays a vital role in reaching to solution. According to the rules, a guest can share a cup of water if he/she wants. So, in this approach, N/2 guests can form a group with each other and agree to get a single cup of water for the whole group. If there are an odd number of guests, any one group can have a person extra. This might sound like the obvious yet ineffective solution but it might solve the problem.
Analysis:
-Cooperative guests avoid conflicts and work together to get a cup.
-Odd-numbered groups might have an extra person.
