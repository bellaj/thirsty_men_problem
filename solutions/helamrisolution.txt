If the guests are smart then they will not cheat, because the bottle can only fill 3 cups, and cheating can lead to conflict and may not be a sustainable solution. If the guests are able to find a way to cheat and consistently get more water than the others, it is likely that the other guests will become frustrated and may try to find ways to counter the cheating. This could lead to a cycle of retaliation and further cheating, which may ultimately undermine trust and cooperation among the guests.

A better solution would be for the guests to try to find a way to fairly divide the water among themselves. This could involve coming up with a rotation system, negotiating with each other, or finding some other fair and equitable solution. By working together and finding a compromise, the guests can avoid conflict and ensure that everyone's needs are met.
