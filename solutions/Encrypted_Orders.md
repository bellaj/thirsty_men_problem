Since the game is only one round. We will have to give all the participants a way to satisfy them and yet end the game.

Let N be the number of participants and let P be the pourrer.

When P invites the participants, he will prepare an ecryption scheme to be used:
  - he first starts by encrypting the number from 1 to N using that scheme.
  - Keep the participants from knowing the decryption key.
  - Put the cups on the table and write on them their encrypted order.
  - Tell the participants that choosing a cup means agreeing on the game conditions.
  - Participants will have to choose cups, each one cup, and once a cup is chosen, the choice cannot be reverted.
  - P will share the decryption key with the participants and they will put the cups according to their decrypted order.
  
If a participant is not satisfied with his order, P will kick him from the game.
