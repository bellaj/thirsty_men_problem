In this scenario, it is likely that the guests will try to cheat in order to get a cup of water. 
They may try to move cups around on the table or place multiple cups in the first or last position
in order to increase their chances of getting a filled cup.
A possible solution to avoid a deadlock would be to assign a specific order for the guests to place
their cups on the table. This could be done by assigning numbers to each guest and having them place 
their cups in numerical order. This would ensure that only one cup is in the first and last positions 
at a time, preventing guests from placing multiple cups in those positions.
