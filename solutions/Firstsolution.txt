My solution to the problem is as follows:
1. Every participant writes his name under the cup at the bottom and puts the cup on the table in any place.
2. Host chooses the first winner. Winner puts his cup in the first place and mixes the rest of the cups and puts them in one row. 
Names are hidden in the bottom under the cup so he will not see written names. The first winner is alredy the winner, so he is not
interested in cheating, but in case he tries to cheat and look at the names he get's kicked out from the house by the majority and
new first winner is chosen by the host. This is how Randomness will be implemented (non-interested person mixes the cups with hidden names).
3. Cups are now put in the row, host pours the water into first and last cups. At this stage nobody knows who is  the second winner.
First winner drinks his water. According to rules, a guest can drink only from his cup, therefore first winner will not drink from the last cup.
4. First winner turns the second cup and announces the name on it. Loser get's kicked out of the house.  He can't cheat and stay,
because the remaining majority will force him to leave.
5. First winner turns the third cup. Announces the name. Next loser is being kicked out by the majority.
6. Game continues until all names on empty cups are revealed one by one and all loosers are kicked out (one by one) by majority.
7. The participant who remains is the second winner and can now drink his water.
